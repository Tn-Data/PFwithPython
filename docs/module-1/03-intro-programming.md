# Programming: talking to a machine that obeys exactly
<p class="lede">You have the steps and you have the drawing. Now you hand them to a machine whose only question, three billion times a second, is *"what is next?"*</p>
</div>

## The machine you are talking to

Four parts, and you only need the idea of each:

<div class="cols two" markdown>
<div class="card" markdown>
#### CPU — the obsessive worker
The lecture's description is perfect: the CPU is **"obsessed with what is next?"**. A 3.0 GHz CPU asks that question **three billion times per second**. Your program is the list of answers you prepared in advance.
</div>
<div class="card" markdown>
#### Main memory (RAM) — the desk
Stores what the CPU needs *in a hurry*, almost as fast as the CPU itself. But it **vanishes when the power goes off**. Your variables live here.
</div>
<div class="card" markdown>
#### Secondary memory — the cupboard
Hard disks, flash drives. Much slower, but it **keeps information without power**. Your files live here.
</div>
<div class="card" markdown>
#### Input / output — the doors
Screen, keyboard, mouse, microphone, speaker, and the network. Every way you and the machine reach each other.
</div>

!!! life "The desk and the cupboard"
    Think of studying. The **desk** is your RAM — whatever you spread out in front of you, fast to reach, but cleared every evening. The **cupboard** is your hard disk — slower to fetch from, but things stay there for years. When you press Ctrl+S, you are moving work from the desk to the cupboard. When a program "loses your work," it never made that move.

## What programming actually is

The lecture defines a programming task in two phases, and this is the map for the entire course:

1. **Problem-solving phase** — define the problem and produce an ordered sequence of steps. *That was Lessons 1 and 2.*
2. **Implementation phase** — write those steps in some programming language. *That is everything from here on.*

And the line from the slides worth keeping: **your program is the "story," and the problem you are trying to solve is the "story dilemma."** Learning vocabulary is not enough. You have to organise the story so a reader can follow it.

Which is why once you learn Python properly, picking up JavaScript or C++ is mostly learning new vocabulary. **The problem-solving skill is the same in every language.**

## Syntax and semantics

Every language — spoken or programming — has two layers:

- **Syntax** — the rules for writing correctly. The grammar.
- **Semantics** — the meaning. What the code actually does.

The lecture's example shows two statements with **different syntax and the same semantics**:

| Language | Statement | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Python | `print("Hello, World")` | Show *Hello, World* on the screen |
| C | `printf("Hello, World");` | Show *Hello, World* on the screen |

Same meaning, different spelling — and notice C insists on the semicolon while Python does not. Write Python's line in C and it fails. This is why "I know programming" always means "I know programming *in* something."

Your first program, the one everybody starts with:

```runpy
title: Hello, World
sub: your first program
---
print("Hello, World")

# Now make it yours:
name = "Ahmed"
print("Hello,", name, "- welcome to Python!")
```

## Why Python, and what "interpreted" means

The computer only understands machine language — pure 1s and 0s. Everything we write has to be translated. There are two ways to translate, and it changes how it feels to learn:

| | Compiler | Interpreter |
|---|---|---|
| **How** | Translates the **entire** code before running it | Translates and runs **line by line** |
| **Produces** | An executable file (`.exe`, `.dll`) | Nothing — it runs the source directly |
| **Speed** | Faster, once compiled | Usually slower |
| **Errors appear** | Before execution | During execution |
| **Examples** | C, C++, C# | **Python**, Ruby, PHP |

!!! life "The translator in the room"
    A **compiler** is like handing a whole book to a translator and waiting a week for the finished translation. An **interpreter** is like having a translator standing beside you at a meeting, translating each sentence as you say it. Slower overall — but you find out immediately when you've said something wrong. That immediate feedback is exactly why Python is a good first language, and why the Run buttons on this page work at all.

Java sits in the middle — it compiles to an intermediate **byte code** that then runs on a virtual machine. That is called a **hybrid** language.

## The four kinds of mistake

This is the most practical section in Module 1. As the lecture warns: **the smallest deviation will cause Python to give up looking at your program.** Knowing *which* kind of mistake you've made is half of fixing it.

| Error | When it appears | Does the program run? |
|---|---|---|
| **Syntax** | Before anything runs | No — not a single line |
| **Runtime** | Part-way through | Starts, then crashes |
| **Logic** | Never announced | Yes — with a wrong answer |
| **Semantic** | Never announced | Yes — with a wrong answer |

### Syntax errors — you broke the grammar

Python checks the rules before it runs anything. Break one and nothing executes. Run this broken program and read what Python tells you:

```runpy
title: A syntax error, on purpose
sub: nothing will run at all
---
x = 10

if x > 5
    print("x is greater than 5")

# Python stops before running ANYTHING - even the first line.
# Fix: put a colon after the condition, like this:  if x > 5:
# Then press Run again.
```

The lecture's list of the syntax errors beginners actually hit:

| Mistake | Wrong | Right |
|---|---|---|
| Missing colon | `if x > 5` | `if x > 5:` |
| Indentation error | body not pushed in | body indented 4 spaces |
| Reserved keyword as a variable | `def = "Ahmed"` | `st_name = "Ahmed"` |
| Unmatched quotation | `print('Hello!)` | `print('Hello!')` |
| Unbalanced brackets | `print("Sum: " + (5 + 3)` | `print("Sum: " + str(5 + 3))` |
| Missing comma in a list | `[1, 2, 3 4, 5]` | `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` |
| `=` instead of `==` | `if x = 10:` | `if x == 10:` |

That last one deserves a sentence of its own. `=` means **"put this value into this box."** `==` means **"are these two the same?"** They are completely different jobs that happen to look alike.

### Runtime errors — the program starts, then hits a wall

The grammar was fine, so Python began executing. Then it met something impossible. Notice the first line *does* print before the crash:

```runpy
title: A runtime error
sub: it runs, then it crashes
---
print("This line works fine.")

result = 10 / 0        # ZeroDivisionError

print("This line never happens.")

# Try replacing line 3 with each of these, one at a time:
#   total = "5" + 2            -> TypeError
#   num = int("abc")           -> ValueError
#   arr = [1, 2, 3]; print(arr[5])  -> IndexError
```

| Runtime error | Example | What happened |
|---|---|---|
| `ZeroDivisionError` | `10 / 0` | You divided by zero. |
| `TypeError` | `"5" + 2` | You mixed incompatible types — text and a number. |
| `ValueError` | `int("abc")` | Right type, impossible value. |
| `IndexError` | `[1,2,3][5]` | You asked for an item that isn't there. |
| `FileNotFoundError` | `open("missing.txt")` | The file doesn't exist. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | `import notreal` | That library isn't installed. |

**Read the last line of the error message first.** It names the error type and usually tells you the line number. Beginners panic at the red text; experienced people read one line of it and go straight to the problem.

### Logic and semantic errors — the dangerous ones

These produce **no error message at all**. The program runs happily and hands you a confident, wrong answer.

```runpy
title: A semantic error — no warning, wrong answer
sub: the most expensive kind of bug
---
length = 10
width  = 4

# The formula for area is multiplication, not addition:
area = length + width

print("Area of the rectangle:", area)
print("...but the true area is:", length * width)

# Python is perfectly happy. It has no idea what an area is.
# Only YOU know the formula is wrong.
```

The other classic from the lecture is order of operations:

| Wrong | Right | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `total = tax + price * discount` | `total = (tax + price) * discount` | Multiplication happens before addition. Without brackets, you discounted only the price and left the tax at full value. |
| `area = length + width` | `area = length * width` | Wrong formula entirely — but perfectly legal Python. |

!!! sowhat "So what?"
    A syntax error costs you two minutes. A logic error can sit inside a working report for a year. This is why **tracing** from Lesson 1 matters so much, and why you always test with a case where you already know the answer. If you can't verify the output by hand on a small example, you have no idea whether the program is right — you only know it didn't crash.

## Putting the whole module together

One last exercise, straight from the lecture, that uses everything: input, process, output, a formula, and a loop.

!!! note "The problem"
    Money is deposited in a bank. Given the **principal P**, the annual **rate R**, the **time T** in years, and **n**, the number of times the bank compounds per year, calculate the final amount `A = P × (1 + R/(100n)) ^ (nT)` and the compound interest `CI = A − P`. Then print the total at the end of *every* year from 1 to T.

Before you look at any code: what is the **input**, what is the **process**, what is the **output**? And which construct do you need for "every year from 1 to T"?

```runpy
title: Compound interest, year by year
sub: the full module in one program
inputs:
  - 10000
  - 12
  - 5
  - 4
input_hint: P (EGP), R (rate %), T (years), n (times compounded per year)
---
P = float(input("Principal P (EGP): "))
R = float(input("Rate R (% per year): "))
T = int(input("Time T (years): "))
n = int(input("Compounds per year n: "))

# Loop through every year from 1 to T
year = 1
while year <= T:
    A = P * (1 + R / (100 * n)) ** (n * year)
    print("End of year", year, "-> A =", round(A, 2), "EGP")
    year = year + 1

CI = A - P
print()
print("Final amount      =", round(A, 2), "EGP")
print("Compound interest =", round(CI, 2), "EGP")

# ** means "to the power of".  round(x, 2) keeps 2 decimal places.
```
