# Visualisation with pandas
<p class="lede">A table of 891 numbers tells you nothing at a glance. The same numbers as a picture tell you the answer in a second. Pandas can draw the common charts directly, with one method call.</p>

## The Python plotting libraries

| Library | What it's for |
|---|---|
| **Matplotlib** | the foundation. Total control over every pixel — axes, gridlines, colours. Can draw almost anything, but verbose. |
| **Seaborn** | built on top of Matplotlib, designed for statistics. Heatmaps and violin plots that look good by default. |
| **Plotly / Bokeh** | interactive charts for the web — zoom, pan, hover for details. For dashboards. |

This lesson uses **`pandas.plot()`**, which is a thin, convenient layer over Matplotlib. It's limited, and that's the point: it's for **quick exploratory analysis**, when you want to *see* the data, not publish it.

!!! trap "These cells load two libraries"
    Every cell on this page needs **pandas and matplotlib** — roughly 20 MB on first Run. Give the first one 30–60 seconds. Every cell after that runs instantly.

## Choosing the right chart

This table is the most useful thing on the page. The mistake beginners make isn't drawing a chart badly — it's drawing the *wrong kind*.

| Chart | Variable types | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| **Histogram** | one numerical | **Distribution** — how values spread out |
| **Pie chart** | one categorical | **Composition** — how parts make up a whole |
| **Bar chart** | categorical + numerical | **Comparison** — values across categories |
| **Stacked bar** | categorical + numerical | **Comparison and composition** at once |
| **Box plot** | categorical + numerical | **Comparison** of distributions across categories |
| **Line chart** | numerical vs numerical, or time series | **Relationship** or trend over time |
| **Scatter plot** | numerical vs numerical | **Relationship** between two variables |

!!! sowhat "The question decides the chart"
    Ask yourself what you're trying to show: *distribution*, *composition*, *comparison*, or *relationship*. Each word points at a different row in that table. A pie chart of numerical data, or a line chart across unordered categories, isn't a style mistake — it's a claim about your data that isn't true.

## Bar chart — comparison

```runpy
title: A simple bar chart
sub: comparing values across categories
packages: [pandas, matplotlib]
---
import pandas as pd

data = {'Student': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],
        'Math': [10, 20, 30, 40],
        'Economics': [5, 15, 25, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

df.plot.bar(x='Student', title='Scores by student')

print(df)
print("\nThe chart appears below the text output.")
```

## Histogram — distribution

```runpy
title: A histogram
sub: where do the values cluster?
packages: [pandas, matplotlib]
---
import pandas as pd
from pyodide.http import open_url

df = pd.read_csv(open_url(DATA_URL + "titanic.csv"))

df['age'].plot.hist(bins=20, title='Distribution of passenger age')

print("Age statistics:")
print(df['age'].describe().round(2))
```

!!! life "What `bins` does"
    A histogram sorts values into buckets and counts each bucket. `bins=20` means twenty buckets. Too few and you flatten out real structure; too many and you see noise. Try `bins=5` and `bins=100` on the cell above — the data hasn't changed at all, but the story it appears to tell has. Always try a couple of values before you believe a shape.

## Scatter plot — relationship

```runpy
title: A scatter plot
sub: two numerical variables against each other
packages: [pandas, matplotlib]
---
import pandas as pd
from pyodide.http import open_url

df = pd.read_csv(open_url(DATA_URL + "titanic.csv"))

df.plot.scatter(x='age', y='fare', title='Passenger age vs fare paid', alpha=0.5)

print("Correlation between age and fare:",
      round(df['age'].corr(df['fare']), 3))
print("\nWeak. The scatter shows why: fare is driven by class, not age.")
```

## Bar chart of counts

```runpy
title: Counting categories, then plotting
sub: value_counts() feeds straight into plot.bar()
packages: [pandas, matplotlib]
---
import pandas as pd
from pyodide.http import open_url

df = pd.read_csv(open_url(DATA_URL + "titanic.csv"))

sex_count = df['sex'].value_counts()
print(sex_count)
sex_count.plot.bar(title='Passenger count by sex', ylabel='Count', rot=0)

class_count = df['pclass'].value_counts().sort_index()
print()
print(class_count)
class_count.plot.bar(title='Passenger count by class', ylabel='Count', rot=0)
```

!!! trap "`.sort_index()` on that second one"
    `value_counts()` sorts by **frequency**, largest first — so the classes would come out in the order 3, 1, 2. For a category with a natural order (class 1, 2, 3; Jan, Feb, Mar; low/medium/high), always `.sort_index()` before plotting, or your chart tells the reader a sequence that doesn't exist.

## Box plot — comparing distributions

A box plot shows the median, the quartiles, and the range in one shape — so you can compare whole distributions side by side instead of just their averages.

```runpy
title: A box plot
sub: fare paid, by survival
packages: [pandas, matplotlib]
---
import pandas as pd
from pyodide.http import open_url

df = pd.read_csv(open_url(DATA_URL + "titanic.csv"))

df.boxplot(column='fare', by='survived', sym='')
# sym='' hides the outlier dots, which otherwise squash the boxes flat

print(df.groupby('survived')['fare'].describe().round(2))
```

!!! sowhat "Why the box plot beats the mean here"
    The table above shows survivors paid a higher **average** fare. But the box plot shows something the average hides: the two distributions overlap heavily. Plenty of people who paid a lot still died, and plenty who paid little survived.

    "Group A has a higher mean than group B" is one of the easiest ways to mislead with data — and with real people's lives in the rows, it matters. The box plot makes the spread visible, so you can see how much of the story the average is leaving out.

## Line chart — trends

```runpy
title: A line chart
sub: for time series and ordered data
packages: [pandas, matplotlib]
---
import pandas as pd

# Egypt's population, in millions, at ten-year intervals
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Year': [1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020],
    'Population': [26.6, 34.8, 43.3, 55.2, 66.1, 82.0, 102.3]
})

df.plot.line(x='Year', y='Population', marker='o',
             title='Population of Egypt, 1960-2020', ylabel='Millions')

print(df)
print("\nGrowth over the period:",
      round((102.3 / 26.6 - 1) * 100, 1), "%")
```

!!! trap "Line charts imply continuity"
    Joining points with a line says "the values in between follow this path." That's true for population over time. It is **not** true for a line chart across countries or product categories — there's nothing between Egypt and France for the line to represent. Unordered categories get a bar chart.

## Pie chart — composition

```runpy
title: A pie chart
sub: use sparingly
packages: [pandas, matplotlib]
---
import pandas as pd
from pyodide.http import open_url

df = pd.read_csv(open_url(DATA_URL + "titanic.csv"))

counts = df['pclass'].value_counts().sort_index()
counts.plot.pie(autopct='%1.1f%%', title='Passengers by class', ylabel='')

print(counts)
```

!!! sowhat "Why professionals avoid pie charts"
    People judge angles badly. Three slices at 30%, 33%, and 37% look essentially identical in a pie, and completely distinct as bars. A pie works only with very few slices, and when the message is genuinely "these are parts of one whole." For everything else, a bar chart is more honest and easier to read.

## See what else is available

```runpy
title: Explore the plot methods
sub: dir() from Module 2, put to work
packages: [pandas, matplotlib]
---
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6]})

kinds = [m for m in dir(df.plot) if not m.startswith('_')]
print("Available plot types:")
for k in kinds:
    print("  df.plot." + k + "()")
```
