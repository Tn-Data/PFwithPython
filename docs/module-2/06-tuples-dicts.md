# Tuples and dictionaries
<p class="lede">A tuple is a list that refuses to change. A dictionary looks things up by name instead of by position. Between them and the list, you can represent almost any dataset you'll meet.</p>
</div>

## Tuples

A tuple is virtually identical to a list, with **one important difference: tuples are immutable.** Once created, you cannot add, remove, or replace an element.

- Written with **parentheses** `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.
- Can hold any mix of data types, including lists, dictionaries, and other tuples.
- Accessing and slicing work exactly as with lists.

```runpy
title: Creating and slicing tuples
sub: everything works like a list...
---
x = (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90)
y = ('first', 'second', 'third')
z = (1871, 'Ahmed', 'Amer', ['Math', 'Arabic'], (20, 30))   # mixed types

print(type(z))

x = x + y            # + creates a NEW tuple
print(x, len(x))

print("x[5:10]  ->", x[5:10])
print("y[-3:-1] ->", y[-3:-1])
print("x[:-3]   ->", x[:-3])
```

```runpy
title: ...until you try to change one
sub: this cell is meant to fail
---
x = (0, 10, 20, 30)
print("The tuple is:", x)

x[0] = 7        # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

print("This line never runs.")
```

!!! trap "One sneaky exception"
    A tuple is immutable, but if it *contains* a mutable object — a list, say — that inner object can still be changed:

    ```python
    x = ([1, 2], [3, 4])
    x[0][1] = 7      # allowed!  x is now ([1, 7], [3, 4])
    ```

    The tuple's promise is "I will always hold these same *objects*," not "these objects will never change."

### Why would you want a container that can't change?

```runpy
title: Tuple methods
sub: there are only two
---
# Inflation rates (%) over 10 years - fixed historical data
rates = (2.1, 1.8, 2.5, 3.0, 2.8, 1.9, 2.5, 3.2, 2.8, 2.5)

print("Rates over 10 years:", rates)
print("2.5% occurred:", rates.count(2.5), "times")
print("First 3.0% at year index:", rates.index(3.0))

# set() removes duplicates; tuple() turns the result back into a tuple
print("Unique rates:", tuple(set(rates)))
```

!!! sowhat "So what?"
    Immutability is a **safety feature**. Historical inflation figures, the days of the week, a set of fixed economic indicators — none of these should ever change while your program runs. Storing them in a tuple means an accidental `rates[3] = 99` crashes loudly instead of silently corrupting your analysis. Tuples are also slightly faster, because Python knows their size can never change.

### Looping over tuples

```runpy
title: One loop, three containers
sub: tuple, list, and string all behave the same
---
print("Loop over a tuple")
for number in (0, 1, 2, 3):
    print(" ", number)

print("Loop over a list")
for i in [0, 10, 20, 30]:
    print(" ", i)

print("Loop over a string")
for letter in "Python":
    print(" ", letter)
```

```runpy
title: A list of tuples
sub: unpacking three values at once
---
team = [('Ahmed', 20, 'center'),
        ('Anas', 22, 'point guard'),
        ('Wael', 22, 'shooting guard'),
        ('Ameer', 21, 'power forward'),
        ('Ali', 19, 'small forward')]

total = 0
for name, age, position in team:        # unpack each tuple into 3 names
    print(f"{name:8} {position}")
    total += age

print("\nTeam average age:", total / len(team))
print("team[1]      ->", team[1])
print("team[1][2]   ->", team[1][2])
print("team[2:4]    ->", team[2:4])
```

A list of tuples is one of the most natural shapes for a table of records — each tuple is a row. In Module 3 you'll see pandas take this idea much further.

## Dictionaries

A dictionary stores data as **key: value** pairs. You look things up by **name**, not by position.

- Written with **curly brackets** `{}`, or built with `dict()`.
- **Values** can be any type, and can repeat.
- **Keys** must be unique and immutable (strings, numbers, tuples).
- Dictionaries **are** changeable — you can add, modify, and remove items.

```runpy
title: Your first dictionary
sub: keys, values, and items
---
country_capitals = {
    "Germany": "Berlin",
    "Canada": "Ottawa",
    "England": "London"
}

print(country_capitals)
print()
print("The capital of Canada is", country_capitals["Canada"])
```

In that dictionary: `Germany`, `Canada`, `England` are the **keys**; `Berlin`, `Ottawa`, `London` are the **values**; and each `key: value` pair is an **item**.

!!! life "Why it's called a dictionary"
    In a paper dictionary you don't look up the 4,213th word — you look up *"economics."* That's exactly the difference between a list (give me item number 4213) and a dictionary (give me the value stored under this name). And just as a real dictionary can't define the same word twice, **keys must be unique**.

### Four ways to create one

```runpy
title: Four routes to the same dictionary
sub: pick whichever reads best
---
# 1. dict() with keyword arguments
p1 = dict(first_name="Rob", surname="Jone", gender="Male", favourite_food="Pizza")

# 2. dict() with a list of tuples
p2 = dict([("first_name", "Rob"), ("surname", "Jone"),
           ("gender", "Male"), ("favourite_food", "Pizza")])

# 3. Curly brackets - the most common
p3 = {"first_name": "Rob", "surname": "Jone",
      "gender": "Male", "favourite_food": "Pizza"}

# 4. Start empty, then fill it in
p4 = {}
p4["first_name"] = "Rob"
p4["surname"] = "Jone"
p4["gender"] = "Male"
p4["favourite_food"] = "Pizza"

print(p1 == p2 == p3 == p4)      # all four are identical
print(p3)
```

!!! trap "One key, one value"
    `{'numbers': 1, 2, 3}` is an error — a key can only point at a single value. If you want several, wrap them in one container: `{'numbers': [1, 2, 3]}`. That's perfectly valid, and very common.

### Dictionary methods

| Method | Does |
|---|---|
| `keys()` | all the keys |
| `values()` | all the values |
| `items()` | all the key–value pairs |
| `pop(key)` | remove the item with that key |
| `popitem()` | remove the last inserted item |
| `update()` | merge in more key–value pairs |
| `copy()` | an independent copy |
| `clear()` | remove everything |

```runpy
title: keys, values, items
sub: the three views of a dictionary
---
pd = {"first_name": "Rob", "surname": "Jone",
      "gender": "Male", "favourite_food": "Pizza"}

print("keys()  :", list(pd.keys()))
print("values():", list(pd.values()))
print()
print("items():")
for key, value in pd.items():
    print(f"   {key:16} -> {value}")
```

```runpy
title: Adding, changing, checking, removing
sub: dictionaries are mutable
---
pd = {"first_name": "Rob", "surname": "Jone", "favourite_food": "Pizza"}
print("start      :", pd)

pd['hobby'] = 'tennis'              # add a new item
print("after add  :", pd)

pd['first_name'] = 'James'          # update an existing one
print("after edit :", pd)

print("Is 'hobby' a key?", 'hobby' in pd)

pd.pop('favourite_food')            # remove by key
del pd['hobby']                     # another way to remove
print("after removes:", pd)

pd2 = pd.copy()                     # remember the copy trap from Lesson 5!
pd.clear()
print("pd :", pd)
print("pd2:", pd2)
```

### Nested dictionaries

Values can themselves be lists or dictionaries — which is how real, structured data looks.

```runpy
title: Reaching into nested data
sub: chain the brackets
---
person = {
    'first_name': 'Mona',
    'last_name': 'Saber',
    'age': 25,
    'country': 'Egypt',
    'is_married': True,
    'skills': ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node', 'MongoDB', 'Python'],
    'address': {'street': 'Kareem Banona', 'zipcode': '02210'}
}

print("Looping over a dictionary gives you the KEYS:")
for i, key in enumerate(person, start=1):
    print("  ", i, key)

print()
print("skills        ->", person['skills'])
print("skills[2]     ->", person['skills'][2])
print("address street->", person['address']['street'])
```

## Worked examples

### Character frequency

```runpy
title: Count every character in a string
sub: building a dictionary in a loop
---
txt = "Hello, I love feps"

txt_dic = {}
for char in set(txt.lower()):        # set() gives the unique characters
    txt_dic[char] = txt.lower().count(char)

# Sort by count, highest first, just to make it readable
for char, count in sorted(txt_dic.items(), key=lambda pair: -pair[1]):
    label = "'" + char + "'" if char != " " else "(space)"
    print(f"{label:9} {count}")
```

### Marketing campaign analysis

```runpy
title: Which advertising platform performs best?
sub: dictionaries + list comprehension
---
def suggest_improvement(ctr_data, min_ctr=4.0):
    low_ctr = [p for p, c in ctr_data.items() if c < min_ctr]
    if low_ctr:
        print(f"Platforms needing improvement (CTR < {min_ctr}%): {low_ctr}")
    else:
        print("All platforms are performing well!")

# Click-through rate per platform, in %
ad_ctr = {
    "Google Ads": 5.4,
    "Facebook Ads": 3.8,
    "Instagram Ads": 4.2,
    "LinkedIn Ads": 1.9
}

top = max(ad_ctr.values())
best = [k for k, v in ad_ctr.items() if v == top]
print("Best advertising platform:", best)
print()

suggest_improvement(ad_ctr)
suggest_improvement(ad_ctr, 2)
```

### A list of dictionaries — the shape of real data

```runpy
title: Survey responses
sub: this is one step away from a pandas DataFrame
---
def avg_hours(entries):
    return sum(e["hours"] for e in entries) / len(entries)

def heavy_users(entries, limit=2):
    return [e["name"] for e in entries if e["hours"] > limit]

data = [
    {"name": "Alice",   "age": 22, "platform": "Instagram", "hours": 3},
    {"name": "Bob",     "age": 25, "platform": "Facebook",  "hours": 1},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 19, "platform": "TikTok",    "hours": 4},
    {"name": "David",   "age": 30, "platform": "Twitter",   "hours": 2},
]

for row in data:
    print(row)

avg = avg_hours(data)
print("\nAverage hours:", round(avg, 2))
print("Heavy users (more than 2 hours):", heavy_users(data))
print(f"Heavy users (more than {round(avg,2)} hours):", heavy_users(data, avg))
```

!!! sowhat "Look at that shape carefully"
    A **list of dictionaries**, where every dictionary has the same keys, is a table: each dictionary is a row, each key is a column. You have just built a dataset by hand. In Module 3, `pd.DataFrame(data)` turns that exact structure into something you can sort, filter, group, and plot in one line each.

### Sheet 4, Ex 4 — price elasticity of demand

```runpy
title: "Sheet 4, Ex 4: price elasticity"
sub: a dictionary of dictionaries
---
products = {
    "Laptop":     {"p0": 1000, "p1": 1500, "q0": 50,  "q1": 20},
    "Smartphone": {"p0": 800,  "p1": 1000, "q0": 200, "q1": 400},
    "Headphones": {"p0": 100,  "p1": 80,   "q0": 500, "q1": 700},
    "Camera":     {"p0": 1200, "p1": 1100, "q0": 30,  "q1": 35},
    "Monitor":    {"p0": 300,  "p1": 330,  "q0": 100, "q1": 130},
}

print("Price Elasticity of Demand:\n")
for product, data in products.items():
    P0, P1 = data["p0"], data["p1"]
    Q0, Q1 = data["q0"], data["q1"]

    price_change = (P1 - P0) / P0
    qty_change = (Q1 - Q0) / Q0

    if price_change != 0:
        elasticity = round(qty_change / price_change, 2)
    else:
        elasticity = float('inf')

    if elasticity > 1:
        category = "Elastic"
    elif elasticity < 1:
        category = "Inelastic"
    else:
        category = "Unitary"

    print(f"{product:12} Elasticity = {elasticity:6} -> {category}")
```

!!! life "Reading the result"
    Elasticity above 1 means demand is **elastic** — a small price rise loses you a lot of customers, so raising prices may cut total revenue. Below 1 is **inelastic** — people buy it anyway (fuel, medicine, bread), so a price rise increases revenue. This one number drives an enormous amount of real pricing policy.

## The three containers, side by side

| | Tuple | List | Dictionary |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Definition** | immutable ordered collection | mutable ordered collection | key–value pairs |
| **Example** | `gdp = (2.5, 3.1, 2.8)` | `countries = ['USA', 'UK']` | `pop = {'USA': 331, 'UK': 68}` |
| **Mutable?** | no | yes | yes (keys unique) |
| **Indexing** | by position | by position | **by key** |
| **Duplicates** | allowed | allowed | keys must be unique |
| **Speed** | fastest (fixed size) | slower (dynamic) | optimised for key lookup |
| **Use when** | the data must not change | the data needs editing | you need to look things up by name |
| **Methods** | `count()`, `index()` | `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()` | `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `get()` |

---

That's Module 2. Test yourself: **[Check yourself](07-quiz.md)** — then Module 3 puts all of it to work on real data.
