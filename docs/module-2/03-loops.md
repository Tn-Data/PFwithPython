# Loops: for and while
<p class="lede">A loop repeats a block of instructions so you don't have to write it out a hundred times. You met the idea as a flowchart in Module 1 — here it becomes two Python keywords.</p>
</div>

## Which loop, and when

The rule is about **what you know before you start**:

<div class="cols two" markdown>
<div class="card" markdown>
#### `for` — a known number of repeats
You know in advance how many times, or you have a collection to walk through.

*"Grade all 40 students." "Print every country in this list."*
</div>
<div class="card" markdown>
#### `while` — an unknown number of repeats
You repeat until some condition stops being true, and you can't say up front how long that takes.

*"Keep asking until they type a valid number."*
</div>
</div>

## The while loop

The four parts from Module 1 are still the four parts. Miss the fourth and the loop never ends.

```runpy
title: The four parts of a while loop
sub: initialise · test · body · update
---
I = 1                          # 1. initialise the control variable

while I <= 5:                  # 2. test the condition
    print("Hello Feps")        # 3. the body - what gets repeated
    I = I + 1                  # 4. update the control variable

print("Finished. I ended at", I)

# Delete line 6 and press Run. This page will stop you after a
# few hundred thousand steps and tell you the loop never ends.
```

!!! sowhat "So what?"
    The update line is the single most-forgotten line in programming. In a browser an infinite loop freezes the tab; in a real script it burns CPU until you kill it; in a program that writes to a file or a database it can fill a disk. When a program "hangs," the first thing to check is whether some counter stopped moving.

## The for loop and range()

A `for` loop walks through a sequence, taking one item at a time. The most common sequence is produced by `range()`.

```runpy
title: How range() works
sub: three ways to call it
---
# range(stop) - starts at 0, stops BEFORE stop
for i in range(5):
    print("range(5) gives", i)

print()

# range(start, stop)
for i in range(2, 6):
    print("range(2, 6) gives", i)

print()

# range(start, stop, step)
for i in range(0, 21, 5):
    print("range(0, 21, 5) gives", i)
```

!!! trap "range() stops *before* the last number"
    `range(5)` gives you 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 — five numbers, but never 5 itself. To count 1 to 100 inclusive you need `range(1, 101)`. This "off-by-one" is probably the most common single bug in all of programming; it has its own name for a reason.

The same job, both ways:

```runpy
title: Sum 1 to 100, with each kind of loop
sub: same answer, different tool
---
# --- with while ---
total = 0
n = 1
while n <= 100:
    total = total + n
    n = n + 1
print("while loop:", total)

# --- with for ---
total = 0
for n in range(1, 101):
    total = total + n
print("for loop:  ", total)

# --- and the way you'd really write it ---
print("built-in:  ", sum(range(1, 101)))
```

## Looping over a collection

A `for` loop doesn't need `range()` at all — it can walk straight through a list or a string. This is the form you'll use most once Lesson 5 introduces lists.

```runpy
title: Looping over things that aren't numbers
sub: lists and strings
---
countries = ["Egypt", "Sudan", "Jordan", "Morocco"]

for country in countries:
    print("Country:", country)

print()

for letter in "Python":
    print(letter)
```

## break and continue

Two words that change the flow from inside the loop:

- **`break`** — leave the loop immediately.
- **`continue`** — skip the rest of this pass and go to the next one.

```runpy
title: break and continue
sub: use sparingly, but know them
---
# break: stop as soon as we find what we're after
for n in [4, 8, 15, 23, 42]:
    if n % 2 != 0:
        print("First odd number found:", n)
        break
    print(n, "is even, keep looking")

print()

# continue: skip the ones we don't want
for n in range(1, 11):
    if n % 3 != 0:
        continue          # not a multiple of 3 - skip to the next n
    print(n, "is a multiple of 3")
```

## Nested loops

A loop inside a loop. The inner one runs completely for **every single pass** of the outer one.

```runpy
title: A multiplication table
sub: a loop inside a loop
---
for row in range(1, 6):
    line = ""
    for col in range(1, 6):
        line = line + str(row * col).rjust(4)
    print(line)
```

!!! trap "Nested loops multiply, they don't add"
    Two loops of 1,000 each, nested, is **one million** passes — not two thousand. That's still instant here. But three nested loops over 10,000 records each is a trillion passes, which is not a slow program, it is a program that never finishes. This is the "time complexity" idea from Module 1 arriving in practice.

## The two modelling exercises

Both of these come from the lecture sheets, and both are the same shape: a quantity that changes by a **constant rate** each period rather than a fixed amount.

<p style="font-family:var(--serif); font-size:1.2rem; text-align:center; margin:1.3rem 0; color:var(--crimson)">
new value = old value + (old value × rate) &nbsp; → &nbsp; P<sub>t</sub> = P<sub>0</sub>(1 + r)<sup>t</sup>
</p>

This is **exponential growth** (or decay, if the rate is negative), because time sits in the exponent. Population, inflation, and compound interest are all the same formula.

### Population growth

```runpy
title: "Sheet 2, Q18: population growth"
sub: while loop, 10 years
inputs:
  - 1000
  - 0.02
  - 10
input_hint: starting population, growth rate (e.g. 0.02), number of years
---
population = float(input("Initial population: "))
rate = float(input("Growth rate per year (e.g. 0.02 for 2%): "))
years = int(input("Number of years: "))

year = 1
while year <= years:
    population += population * rate
    print("Year", year, ":", round(population, 2))
    year += 1

print(f"\nAfter {years} years the population is {round(population, 2)}")
```

### Inflation

Exactly the same loop, pointed at a price instead of a population — which is the point of the exercise.

```runpy
title: "Sheet 2, Q19: price inflation"
sub: the identical loop, different subject
inputs:
  - 250
  - 0.08
  - 5
input_hint: starting price (EGP), inflation rate, number of years
---
price = float(input("Current price in EGP: "))
rate = float(input("Annual inflation rate (e.g. 0.08 for 8%): "))
years = int(input("Number of years: "))

year = 1
while year <= years:
    price += price * rate
    print(f"Year {year}: {round(price, 2)} EGP")
    year += 1

print(f"\nWhat costs {round(price, 2)} EGP in {years} years costs less today.")
print("That is what inflation does to savings held as cash.")
```

!!! life "Same loop, four different questions"
    Population growth, inflation, compound interest, and currency depreciation are one piece of code with different numbers in it. In Lesson 4 you'll wrap exactly this loop in a function called `growth_model` and call it four times — which is the whole argument for functions in one example.

### Counting things in a list

The other loop exercise from the sheets — count how many times each of two values appears, and report the percentages. This is the shape of nearly every survey analysis you will ever write.

```runpy
title: "Sheet 2, Q20/Q21: counting responses"
sub: a loop with two counters
---
genders = ["Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Female"]

count_male = 0
count_female = 0

for item in genders:
    if item == "Male":
        count_male += 1
    elif item == "Female":
        count_female += 1

total = len(genders)
print("Male  :", count_male, "(", round(count_male / total * 100, 2), "% )")
print("Female:", count_female, "(", round(count_female / total * 100, 2), "% )")

if count_male > count_female:
    print("The majority is Male.")
elif count_female > count_male:
    print("The majority is Female.")
else:
    print("The counts are equal.")

# Now swap in a list of votes and the same code still works:
# votes = ["Mamdani", "Cuomo", "Mamdani", "Mamdani", "Cuomo"]
```

!!! sowhat "So what?"
    Notice you just wrote nearly the same block twice — once for gender, once for votes. That duplication is the smell that tells you a **function** is needed. That is exactly where the next lesson starts.

---

Next: [**Functions and modules**](04-functions.md) — stop writing the same thing twice.
