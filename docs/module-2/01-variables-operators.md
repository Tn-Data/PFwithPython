# Variables, operators, and expressions
<p class="lede">A variable is a labelled box in the computer's memory. An operator is a symbol that does something to what's in the boxes. That's the whole of this lesson — but the details are where beginners lose hours.</p>
</div>

## Variables: named boxes

Information in code is stored in **variables**. A variable is a named container that holds a value in a reserved location in the computer's memory.

If you write `X = 8`, then `X` is the variable **name**, `8` is the **value**, and `X` points to the place in memory where 8 lives.

```runpy
title: Your first variables
sub: four different data types
---
x = 10
y = 1.387668
z = True
name = 'Rob'

print(name, x, y, z)

# type() tells you what kind of value is in each box
print(type(x), type(y), type(z), type(name))
```

The four built-in types you'll use constantly:

| Type | Means | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `int` | whole number | `10` |
| `float` | number with a decimal point | `1.387668` |
| `bool` | True or False | `True` |
| `str` | text ("string") | `'Rob'` |

Unlike many other languages, Python does **not** make you declare the type. It works it out from the value you assign.

!!! trap "Python is case sensitive"
    `X` and `x` are two completely different variables. This catches everybody at least once. If Python says `NameError: name 'total' is not defined` and you can see `Total` right there on screen — that's why.

## Naming rules, and naming manners

**The rules** (break these and Python refuses to run):

- Names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores `_` only.
- They must **begin** with a letter or underscore — never a number.
- No spaces.
- No [reserved keywords](#reserved-keywords).

Valid: `myVar`, `MyVar`, `_myVar`, `MyVar123`
Invalid: `m*var`, `my-var`, `my var`, `1myVar`

**The manners** (break these and Python runs fine, but your future self suffers):

Use descriptive names. `student_name` or `StudentName` beat `sn` every time. It feels excessive while you're typing it and makes perfect sense when you come back in three months.

### Reserved keywords

There are 35 words Python has claimed for itself. You cannot use them as variable names.

```runpy
title: The 35 reserved keywords
sub: run this instead of memorising them
---
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
print()
print("That's", len(keyword.kwlist), "words you can't use as variable names.")
```

Note they're all lowercase except `True`, `False`, and `None`.

## Updating a variable

The most common pattern in all of programming: the new value depends on the old one.

```runpy
title: Increment and decrement
sub: x = x + 1 and its shortcuts
---
x = 6            # initialise x  -  you must do this first
print(x)

x = x + 1        # update x: take the current value, add 1, store it back
print(x)

x += 3           # shortcut: same as x = x + 3
print(x)

x -= 2           # shortcut: same as x = x - 2
print(x)
```

Adding 1 is called an **increment**; subtracting 1 is a **decrement**.

!!! sowhat "So what?"
    You must **initialise** a variable before you can update it. `x = x + 1` when `x` doesn't exist yet gives you a `NameError`, because Python evaluates the right-hand side *first* — and it can't add 1 to something that isn't there. Every loop you write in the next lesson depends on getting this order right.

## Arithmetic operators

The values an operator works on are called **operands**. A statement combining values, variables, and operators is an **expression**.

```runpy
title: All seven arithmetic operators
sub: from the lecture, a = 15 and b = 4
---
a = 15
b = 4

print("Addition:       ", a + b)
print("Subtraction:    ", a - b)
print("Multiplication: ", a * b)
print("Division:       ", a / b)     # always gives a float
print("Floor Division: ", a // b)    # whole part only
print("Modulus:        ", a % b)     # the remainder
print("Exponentiation: ", a ** b)    # a to the power of b

# An expression can combine several of them
mean = (a + b) / 2
var  = (a - mean) ** 2 + (b - mean) ** 2
print()
print("Mean:    ", mean)
print("Variance:", var)
```

!!! life "Where `%` and `//` actually earn their keep"
    You have 17 students and want groups of 5. `17 // 5 = 3` complete groups, and `17 % 5 = 2` students left over. Same two operators handle "how many full boxes and how many loose items", "how many hours and how many minutes", and the digit-reversing trick from Module 1.

## Operator precedence

Python does not read left to right. It follows a priority order, highest first:

| Level | Operator | Description | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (highest) | `()` | Parentheses — override everything | `(2 + 3) * 4` | 20 |
| 2 | `**` | Exponentiation (right to left) | `2 ** 3 ** 2` | 512 |
| 3 | `+x`, `-x` | Unary plus and minus | `-2` | −2 |
| 4 | `*` `/` `//` `%` | Multiply, divide, floor divide, modulus | `10 / 2 * 3` | 15 |
| 5 (lowest) | `+` `-` | Addition and subtraction | `10 - 5 + 2` | 7 |

Work through these by hand *before* you run the cell. The lecture's ten examples:

```runpy
title: Precedence — predict, then run
sub: cover the output and work them out first
---
print("1)  5 + 3 * 2            =", 5 + 3 * 2)
print("2)  10 - 4 / 2 + 3       =", 10 - 4 / 2 + 3)
print("3)  8 + 2 ** 3 * 2       =", 8 + 2 ** 3 * 2)
print("4)  (6 + 2) * 3 ** 2     =", (6 + 2) * 3 ** 2)
print("5)  18 / 3 + 4 * 2       =", 18 / 3 + 4 * 2)
print("6)  20 // 3 + 5 % 3      =", 20 // 3 + 5 % 3)
print("7)  15 - 2 * 3 ** 2 / 6  =", 15 - 2 * 3 ** 2 / 6)
print("8)  4 + 8 / 2 - 5 * 3    =", 4 + 8 / 2 - 5 * 3)
print("9)  30 % 7 + 2 ** 2 * 3  =", 30 % 7 + 2 ** 2 * 3)
print("10) (5 + 3) * 2 ** 3 - 6 / 3 =", (5 + 3) * 2 ** 3 - 6 / 3)
```

??? question "Answers, with the working"
    1. `5 + (3 * 2)` → 5 + 6 = **11**
    2. `10 - (4 / 2) + 3` → 10 − 2 + 3 = **11**
    3. `8 + (2 ** 3) * 2` → 8 + 8 × 2 = **24**
    4. `(8) * (3 ** 2)` → 8 × 9 = **72**
    5. `(18 / 3) + (4 * 2)` → 6 + 8 = **14**
    6. `(20 // 3) + (5 % 3)` → 6 + 2 = **8**
    7. `15 - (2 * 9 / 6)` → 15 − 3 = **12**
    8. `4 + (8 / 2) - (5 * 3)` → 4 + 4 − 15 = **−7**
    9. `(30 % 7) + (2 ** 2) * 3` → 2 + 12 = **14**
    10. `(8) * (2 ** 3) - (6 / 3)` → 64 − 2 = **62**

!!! trap "The one that costs money"
    `total = tax + price * discount` does **not** discount the tax. Multiplication runs first, so only the price gets discounted. You wanted `total = (tax + price) * discount`. This is the semantic error from Module 1 — no crash, no warning, just a wrong number in a report.

## Comparison operators

A **Boolean expression** is one that evaluates to either `True` or `False`. Comparison operators compare two values and hand back a Boolean.

```runpy
title: Comparing two values
sub: every one of these returns True or False
---
a = 15
b = 4

print("a > b   :", a > b)      # greater than
print("a < b   :", a < b)      # less than
print("a == b  :", a == b)     # EQUAL - two equals signs!
print("a != b  :", a != b)     # not equal
print("a >= b  :", a >= b)     # greater than or equal
print("a <= b  :", a <= b)     # less than or equal
```

!!! trap "`=` versus `==`"
    `=` means **"put this value in this box."** `==` means **"are these two the same?"** They look almost identical and do completely unrelated jobs. Writing `if x = 10:` is a syntax error; Python will refuse to run. That's the *lucky* case — in some languages it silently assigns and you never find out.

## Logical operators

Programs make decisions by combining several True/False statements into one, using `and`, `or`, and `not`.

| Operator | Returns True when | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `and` | **both** statements are true | `x > 5 and x < 10` |
| `or` | **at least one** is true | `x > 5 or x < 4` |
| `not` | reverses the result | `not(x > 5)` |

The full truth table:

| A | B | A and B | A or B | not A |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| False | False | False | False | True |
| False | True | False | True | True |
| True | False | False | True | False |
| True | True | True | True | False |

!!! life "Two examples from the lecture"
    **`and`** — a company's stock rises if there is positive sentiment **and** the company made a profit last year. Both must be true.

    **`or`** — a heart monitor sounds the alarm if the pulse is too slow **or** the blood pressure is too weak. One is enough.

    Getting these two mixed up is how you build an alarm that never fires, or one that never stops.

```runpy
title: Logical operators and their precedence
sub: not, then and, then or
---
a = True
b = False

print(a and b)        # False
print(a or b)         # True
print(not a)          # False
print(a and not b)    # True

print()
A = True; B = False; C = True

print("A and B or C        =", A and B or C)
print("A and B or not C    =", A and B or not C)
print("A and B or C and A  =", A and B or C and A)
print("not A and (B or C)  =", not A and (B or C))
```

**Precedence among the three: `not` first, then `and`, then `or`.**

And across all three families, Python evaluates in this order:

<p style="font-family:var(--serif); font-size:1.25rem; text-align:center; margin:1.4rem 0; color:var(--crimson)">
Arithmetic &nbsp;→&nbsp; Comparison &nbsp;→&nbsp; Logical
</p>

```runpy
title: All three families in one expression
sub: predict each before running
---
print("1)", not (8 / 4 == 2) and 3 ** 2 > 8)
print("2)", 12 % 5 + 2 * 3 >= 8 and 7 - 2 < 5)
print("3)", not (4 * 2 > 6) or 10 % 3 == 1)
print("4)", 10 - 3 ** 2 < 5 or 8 % 4 == 2)
print("5)", not (5 + 2 > 8) and 9 // 3 == 3)

# Example 1 step by step:
#   8/4 == 2     -> 2.0 == 2  -> True
#   3**2 > 8     -> 9 > 8     -> True
#   not True and True  ->  False and True  ->  False
```

!!! sowhat "So what?"
    Use parentheses even when you don't strictly need them. `(a and b) or c` costs you two characters and removes all doubt — for you, for your colleague, and for the person marking your code. Relying on precedence you half-remember is how a condition ends up meaning something you never intended.

## Putting it together

The simple interest problem from Module 1, now with real input and f-string output:

```runpy
title: Simple interest, the Python version
sub: input, process, output
inputs:
  - 1000
  - 10
  - 5
input_hint: principal, rate (%), number of years
---
P = int(input("Enter the principal deposit: "))
R = float(input("Rate of interest (0-100) per year: "))
N = int(input("No. of years: "))

SI = round(P * N * (R / 100), 2)
A = P + SI

print(f"\nSimple interest = {SI}")
print(f"Amount of money after {N} years = {A}")
```

!!! life "f-strings"
    `f"... {N} ..."` is an **f-string** (formatted string). Put an `f` before the quotes and anything inside `{ }` gets replaced by its value. It's far easier to read than gluing pieces together with `+`, and you'll see it everywhere from here on.
