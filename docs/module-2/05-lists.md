# Lists and strings
<p class="lede">So far every variable has held one value. A list holds many — and once you can put a hundred numbers in one box, everything you learned about loops suddenly pays off.</p>
</div>

## The four collection types

Python has four built-in ways to store a group of values:

| Type | Written as | Ordered? | Changeable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **List** | `[1, 2, 3, 4]` | yes | yes (mutable) |
| **Tuple** | `(1, 2, 3, 4)` | yes | **no** (immutable) |
| **Set** | `{1, 4, 14, 33}` | no | yes, but unique values only |
| **Dictionary** | `{"Name": "Anita", "Age": 77}` | by key | yes |

This lesson is lists (and strings, which behave similarly). The next covers tuples and dictionaries.

## Creating and indexing a list

A list is an **ordered**, **modifiable** sequence of items — which can be of the same type or different types, including other lists.

The first index is **0**, and the last is **n − 1**.

```runpy
title: Making lists
sub: empty, simple, nested, and mixed
---
x = []                            # an empty list
print(x, type(x))

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]                  # a 1-dimensional list
print(x)

y = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]  # a list of lists (2-dimensional)
print(y)

z = [1, 1.0, 'one', False]        # a mixed list - Python allows it
print(z)
```

```runpy
title: Accessing items by index
sub: positive and negative
---
x = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

print(x[0])     # first item
print(x[5])     # sixth item
print(x[9])     # last item
print(x[-1])    # also the last item
print(x[-6])    # sixth from the end

# print(x[10])  # <- uncomment: IndexError, list index out of range
```

Negative indices count from the end — `-1` is the last item, `-2` the second-to-last:

| item | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **+ index** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| **− index** | −7 | −6 | −5 | −4 | −3 | −2 | −1 |

## Slicing

**`list[start:stop:step]`** — `start` is included, `stop` is **excluded**, `step` defaults to 1.

```runpy
title: Slicing a list
sub: nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
---
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]

print("nums[1:4]   ->", nums[1:4])     # index 1 up to (not including) 4
print("nums[:3]    ->", nums[:3])      # from the start
print("nums[2:]    ->", nums[2:])      # to the end
print("nums[::2]   ->", nums[::2])     # every 2nd item
print("nums[-3:]   ->", nums[-3:])     # last 3 items
print("nums[::-1]  ->", nums[::-1])    # the whole list, reversed
```

```runpy
title: Slicing a list of lists
sub: two indices, one after the other
---
y = [[10, 20, 30, 40], [50, 60, 70, 80]]

print(y[0])        # the first inner list
print(y[1])        # the second inner list
print(y[0][0])     # first item OF the first inner list
print(y[0][1:4])   # a slice of the first inner list
print(y[1][1:4])
```

## The copy trap

This is the single most important slide in the lecture, and it catches people for years.

```runpy
title: Why x = y is dangerous
sub: two names, one list
---
y = [0, 10, 20, 30]
x = y                 # this does NOT make a copy

x.append(100)

print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)       # y changed too!
```

**`x = y` does not create a new list.** It makes `x` and `y` two names for the *same* object in memory. Change one, and the other changes, because there is only one list.

```runpy
title: The fix
sub: .copy() makes a real second list
---
y = [0, 10, 20, 30]
x = y.copy()          # now x is an independent copy

x.append(100)

print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)       # y is untouched
```

!!! sowhat "So what?"
    This is a whole category of bug that produces no error message. You "back up" your data, modify the copy, and discover later that your original was quietly destroyed too. Any time you assign one list to another name and then modify it, ask yourself: did I want a copy, or a second name for the same thing?

## List methods

A **method** is a function attached to an object, called with dot notation: `object.method()`.

| Method | Does |
|---|---|
| `append(x)` | add x to the end |
| `insert(i, x)` | insert x at index i |
| `extend(seq)` | add several items |
| `remove(x)` | remove the first item equal to x |
| `pop(i)` | remove item at index i **and return it** |
| `clear()` | remove everything |
| `sort()` | sort in place, ascending |
| `sort(reverse=True)` | sort in place, descending |
| `reverse()` | reverse in place |
| `index(x)` | position of x |
| `count(x)` | how many times x appears |
| `copy()` | an independent copy |

```runpy
title: append vs extend vs +
sub: three ways to add, two different results
---
y = [0, 10, 20, 30]
w = ['first', 'second', 'third']

x = y.copy()
x.append(w)
print("append :", len(x), x)     # the whole list goes in as ONE item

x = y.copy()
x.extend(w)
print("extend :", len(x), x)     # the items go in individually

x = y.copy()
x = x + w
print("plus   :", len(x), x)     # same result as extend
```

!!! trap "append puts the list *inside* the list"
    `append` adds exactly one item. If that item happens to be a list, you get a nested list, and `len()` goes up by 1 rather than by 3. `extend` (or `+`) is what you want when you mean "add all of these."

```runpy
title: Removing items
sub: del, pop, remove, clear
---
x = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

del x[1:3]
print("after del x[1:3] :", x)

print("x.pop(1) returned:", x.pop(1), "-> x is now", x)

del x[0]
print("after del x[0]   :", x)

x.remove(80)                 # removes by VALUE, not index
print("after remove(80) :", x)

x.clear()
print("after clear()    :", x)
```

```runpy
title: count, reverse, sort, and "in"
sub: rearranging and inspecting
---
y = [1, 8, 7, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 9, 9]

print("count of 1:", y.count(1), " count of 4:", y.count(4))

y.reverse()
print("reversed :", y)

y.sort()
print("sorted   :", y)

y.sort(reverse=True)
print("descending:", y)

print("Is 20 in the list?", 20 in y)
print("Is  8 in the list?", 8 in y)
```

## Methods versus built-in functions

Both act on lists, but the syntax differs — and so does the effect.

```runpy
title: sorted() vs .sort()
sub: the difference that matters
---
x = [35, 20, 30, 15]

print("max, min, sum:", max(x), min(x), sum(x))

print("sorted(x) returns:", sorted(x))
print("x is still       :", x)          # unchanged!

x.sort()
print("after x.sort(), x:", x)          # changed in place
```

**`sorted(x)`** is a built-in function: it gives you a **new** sorted list and leaves the original alone.
**`x.sort()`** is a method: it **rearranges** the original and returns nothing.

Getting these backwards produces either a lost result or a destroyed original.

## Looping over a list

```runpy
title: Median income
sub: a real function, from the lecture
---
def median_income(incomes):
    sorted_incomes = sorted(incomes)
    n = len(sorted_incomes)
    mid = n // 2
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (sorted_incomes[mid] + sorted_incomes[mid - 1]) / 2
    return sorted_incomes[mid]

incomes = [2500, 3200, 4000, 2800, 5000]
print("Median income:", round(median_income(incomes), 2))

# Add a sixth value and run again - the even-length branch takes over
```

```runpy
title: GDP growth rates
sub: looping with an index, because we need the previous item
---
def gdp_growth_rate(gdp_values):
    growth_rates = []
    N = len(gdp_values)
    for i in range(1, N):          # start at 1: item 0 has no previous year
        rate = (gdp_values[i] - gdp_values[i - 1]) / gdp_values[i - 1] * 100
        growth_rates.append(str(round(rate, 2)) + "%")
    return growth_rates

gdp_values = [2.1, 2.3, 2.6, 2.9]      # trillion dollars
print("Growth Rates:", gdp_growth_rate(gdp_values))
```

!!! life "Why the loop starts at 1"
    A growth rate needs a *previous* year to compare against, and the first year hasn't got one. Four years of data give you three growth rates. Any time you compute change-over-time you lose one observation — and forgetting that is how a table ends up misaligned by a row.

## List comprehension

A compact way to build a list from a sequence — and faster than the equivalent `for` loop.

```text
newlist = [expression for item in sequence if condition]
```

```runpy
title: List comprehension
sub: the long way and the short way
---
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]

# copy every item
print([x for x in fruits])

# with a filter
print([x for x in fruits if x != "apple"])

print()
# Even numbers 0 to 20 - the long way
even_numbers = []
for i in range(21):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        even_numbers.append(i)
print("long way :", even_numbers)

# Even numbers 0 to 20 - the comprehension
even_numbers = [i for i in range(21) if i % 2 == 0]
print("short way:", even_numbers)

# Filter positive even numbers out of a mixed list
numbers = [-8, -7, -3, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8, 10]
print("positive evens:", [i for i in numbers if i % 2 == 0 and i > 0])
```

## Strings

Python treats anything in quotes as a **string**. Strings are sequences too, so indexing and slicing work exactly as they do for lists.

| Method | Does |
|---|---|
| `upper()` / `lower()` | change case |
| `capitalize()` | first character to upper case |
| `count()` | how many times a value appears |
| `find()` | position of a value, or −1 if absent |
| `split()` | split into a list at a separator |
| `join()` | join an iterable into one string |
| `replace()` | swap one value for another |
| `strip()` | remove surrounding spaces |
| `isdigit()` | are all characters digits? |

```runpy
title: String methods on a news headline
sub: the lecture's example
---
txt_news = "BBC: babies have died from cold in Gaza over two weeks"

print(txt_news.upper())
print(txt_news.lower())
print("No. of characters =", len(txt_news))

words = txt_news.split()
print("Words:", words)
print("No. of words =", len(words))

sent = txt_news.split("Gaza")
print("Split on 'Gaza':", sent)
```

```runpy
title: Searching inside a string
sub: find() and count()
---
txt_news = "BBC: babies have died from cold in Gaza over two weeks"
words = txt_news.split()

target = "Palestine"
print(f"find('{target}') ->", txt_news.find(target), " (-1 means not found)")

target = "Gaza"
pos = txt_news.find(target)
print(f"find('{target}')      ->", pos)

x = txt_news.count(target)
print(f"Count of '{target}' in the text = {x}")

d = round(x / len(words) * 100, 2)
print(f"Density of '{target}' in the text = {d}%")
```

```runpy
title: Six ways to find the longest word
sub: same answer, six routes
---
txt_news = "BBC: babies have died from cold in Gaza over two weeks"
words = txt_news.split()

# 1. Your own function
def longest_word(words):
    longest = ""
    for w in words:
        if len(w) > len(longest):
            longest = w
    return longest
print("1. own function :", longest_word(words))

# 2. max() with a key
print("2. max(key=len) :", max(words, key=len))

# 3-4. sorted()
print("3. sorted last  :", sorted(words, key=len)[-1])
print("4. sorted first :", sorted(words, key=len, reverse=True)[0])

# 5-6. the .sort() method
words.sort(key=len)
print("5. .sort() last :", words[-1])
words.sort(key=len, reverse=True)
print("6. .sort() first:", words[0])
```

!!! life "`key=len` in one sentence"
    `max(words)` would give you the word that's last alphabetically. `max(words, key=len)` says *"compare them by their length instead."* The `key` argument shows up all over Python — it's how you sort a list of people by age, or a list of countries by GDP.

## Lists of strings

```runpy
title: Building full names
sub: a loop, then the comprehension
---
students = [["Ahmed", "Ali"], ["Dina", "Khaled"], ["Lina", "Ameer"]]

# with a loop
full_name = []
for s in students:
    full_name.append(s[0] + " " + s[1])
print(full_name)

# with a comprehension - one line, same result
full_name = [s[0] + " " + s[1] for s in students]
print(full_name)
```

```runpy
title: Extract email providers
sub: split, filter, de-duplicate
---
def email_provider(emails):
    domains = []
    for email in emails:
        at_index = email.find("@")
        if at_index == -1:          # no @ sign - skip this one
            continue
        domain = email.split('@')[1]
        if domain not in domains:   # avoid duplicates
            domains.append(domain)
    return sorted(domains)

emails = ["alice@gmail.com", "bob@yahoo.com", "charlie@gmail.com",
          "david@outlook.com", "eve@yahoo.com", "frank@company.com"]
print(email_provider(emails))
```

## The exercises

### Sheet 4, Ex 11 — the improved `analyze_list`

The lecture asks you to take the counting function from Lesson 3 and improve it: handle inconsistent capitalisation, and replace the counting loop with the `count()` method.

```runpy
title: analyze_list, improved
sub: lowercase everything, then use .count()
---
def analyze_list(data_list, word1, word2):
    # Handle inconsistent capitalisation
    data_list = [item.lower() for item in data_list]
    word1 = word1.lower()
    word2 = word2.lower()

    total = len(data_list)
    count1 = data_list.count(word1)     # the loop is gone
    count2 = data_list.count(word2)

    print(f"{word1}: {count1} ({round(count1 / total * 100, 2)}%)")
    print(f"{word2}: {count2} ({round(count2 / total * 100, 2)}%)")

    if count1 > count2:
        print(f"The majority is {word1}.\n")
    elif count2 > count1:
        print(f"The majority is {word2}.\n")
    else:
        print("The counts are equal.\n")

# Note the messy capitalisation - it no longer matters
genders = ["Male", "female", "FEMALE", "male", "Female", "female"]
analyze_list(genders, "Male", "Female")

votes = ["Mamdani", "cuomo", "MAMDANI", "Mamdani", "Cuomo"]
analyze_list(votes, "Mamdani", "Cuomo")
```

!!! sowhat "Real survey data is messy"
    `"Male"`, `"male"`, and `"MALE"` are three different strings to a computer and one category to a human. Every dataset you ever receive will have this problem, along with stray spaces (`.strip()`) and inconsistent spellings. Cleaning is not a distraction from the analysis — it *is* most of the analysis.

### Sheet 4, Ex 5 — the Gini coefficient

A real measure of income inequality, from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (one person has everything).

```runpy
title: "Sheet 4, Ex 5: the Gini coefficient"
sub: sorting, looping, and interpreting
---
def gini_coefficient(data):
    sorted_data = sorted(data)
    n = len(sorted_data)
    total = sum(sorted_data)

    numerator = 0
    rank = 1
    for income in sorted_data:
        numerator += income * (2 * rank - (n + 1))
        rank += 1

    G = round(numerator / (n * total), 2)

    if 0 <= G <= 0.3:
        interpretation = "Low"
    elif 0.3 < G <= 0.5:
        interpretation = "Moderate"
    elif 0.5 < G <= 1:
        interpretation = "High"
    else:
        interpretation = "Invalid Gini Index"

    return G, interpretation

incomes = [500, 2000, 1500, 3000, 1000]
gini, interp = gini_coefficient(incomes)
print(f"Gini coefficient: {gini} - {interp} inequality")

# Try [1000, 1000, 1000, 1000] - perfect equality
# Try [10, 10, 10, 100000]     - extreme inequality
```

!!! life "Reading a Gini number"
    0 to 0.3 is low inequality (the Scandinavian countries). 0.3 to 0.5 is moderate (the USA, the UK). Above 0.5 is high. Note the function returns **two** values at once — Python lets you do that, and `gini, interp = ...` unpacks them into two variables.
